For the Abell 57 CEK, I used the dereddened line ratios, as provided by Robin, as input matching for Cloudy.
I set up the input paramters as follows to obtain the ideal matches:
title abell57
sphere
table star rauch H-Ni solar 4.95424 LOG
luminosity solar =     4.0000
HDEN=7.05 LOG
radius = 16
abundances planetary nebula          
metal     1.0000

"h  1" 4101.73A
"h  1" 4340.46A
"He 1" 6678.15A 
end of lines

I used Cloudy's optimizing input to vary individual parameters to match for the three known line ratios 
relative to H-beta, namely H-alpha, [O III] 5007 and He I 5876. The optimizer returned the optimal
parameters as shown above. 

The paramters assume a log luminosity of the CEK in ergs/s, a log total hydrogen density in cm^-3, a log
radius in cm, and planetary nebula abundances. I used the Rauch H-Ni stellar atmospheres 
(as described at http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~rauch/TMAF/flux_H-Ni.html)with a log temperature.
