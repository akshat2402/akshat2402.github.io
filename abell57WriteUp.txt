Abell 57 Cloudy Write Up
CEK:
For the Abell 57 CEK, I used the dereddened line ratios, as provided by Robin, as input matching for Cloudy.
I set up the input paramters as follows to obtain the ideal matches:
title abell57
sphere
table star rauch H-Ni solar 4.95424 LOG
luminosity solar =     4.0000
HDEN=7.05 LOG

"h  1" 4101.73A
"h  1" 4340.46A
"He 1" 6678.15A 
end of lines

I used Cloudy's optimizing input to vary individual parameters to match for the three known line ratios 
relative to H-beta, namely H-alpha, [O III] 5007 and He I 5876. The optimizer returned the optimal
parameters as shown above. 

The paramters assume a log luminosity of the CEK in ergs/s, a log total hydrogen density in cm^-3, a log
radius in cm, and planetary nebula abundances. I used the Rauch H-Ni stellar atmospheres 
(as described at http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~rauch/TMAF/flux_H-Ni.html)with a log temperature.
 
Faint PN:
For the surrounding faint PN, I performed a similar analysis, once again using dereddened line ratios provided by Robin.
I set up cloud, and used the optimizer to obtain the ideal paramters. This run, however, was more difficult,
as there were significantly more ratios to match. The H-alpha, [O III] 5007 and He I 5876 matched well from the start, 
but I had the following ratios to match in addition:
[Ne III] 3689
[Ar IV] 4711
O2 Doublet - this wasn't a matching scenario, rather a comparison to 5007 to ensure a good fit
[N II] 6584
[S II] 6717

After numerous iterations, I was able to obtain the following parameters which matched H-alpha,
[O III] 5007, He I 5876 and [Ne III] 3689 well. It also led to a good ratio for the O2 Doublet
when compared to 5007, implying a good fit. [N II] 6584 and [S II] 6717 however, were not great
fits. 

The ideal parameters are as follows:

title abell57CSFaint
sphere
BLACKbody= 5.082341 LOG
LUMINOSITY 36.790073 LOG range -0.000232 6.866279
HDEN=2.662584 LOG
RADIUS = 0.11 linear parsecs
abundances planetary nebula
metal     1.250
 
Here I assume a blackbody temparature in log scale, and assume spherical geometry.
